What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a new secret folder (.git) that has the properties of a repository. I need it becuse is so useful to have acces to the history of changes that have been made in a project, since it was created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is between them, it's like a preparation before commit something to the repository. It's really good, because I can choose the files or changes I want to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use the commands git diff and git diff --staged to make shure exactly what specific changes I want to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

When I'm not sure if an experimental idea will work out, or when I want to add a feature, but not remove another (i.e. a launguage). They will create a new version of my project without changing the original.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They help me a lot, because I can see easily the parents of a commit, and the specific commits that belong to a determinated branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

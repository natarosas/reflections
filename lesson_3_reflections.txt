When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you want to share your projects, so others can learn from them, or when you want to colaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I can choose when it's necessary, for example some changes could have been added by another person, snd I consider they are not required in my project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    A fork creates a copy of a project in your own GiHub account, and you can modify it. A clone creates a copy of a project from Github or another computer to your local system. And a branch, is a new line of commits that does not affect you project unless you merge it with the principal branch (master).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    When I fletch the remote changes, they will merge with the stored copy I have, and not with the actual branch I'm working on, so that saves problems.
